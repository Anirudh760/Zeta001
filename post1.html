            lets have a little background so that its can be understand beautifully. My parents like anyother
            during there life they went to places to find god or should i say peace somethings like that
            . So they got blessed with OSHODHARA. so typically i also started going their at a very early age
            Their are three gurus so think what that 5-6 yr old kid thought. The gurus where enlighted. So the 
            kid throught they have some kind of power like mind reading and knowledge of everything. As this 
            kid grown and seen the world its obviously not true idk or can be
            <br>
            <br>
            So lets get to topic enlightenment. We usually think it some kind of end product like a treasure 
            which we get it at the end of road and we will be full but thats not the case. Thats what we 
            feed with like remember parents say finish 10th with good marks u will be free and finish 12th u will be free and get a job and earn well u will free. We all think it somekind of end product if we
            get it we will get something but something. let me tell that not it. Enlightenment is what i am still figuring out but what i can say is a journey where u discover yourself from inside through 
            mediation why mediation bsc that only way you close eyes and go inside. Journey that is important 
            as you go deep into yourself and when you reach at the end you be like shock ehh this was it because i already found it before it. It just the part of click which you get like ohh this is enlightenment.
            
            I tried to make it short as possible its my point of view toward which i want to write it somewhere so that i can see in future if POV changed or not.
            <br>THANKYOU
