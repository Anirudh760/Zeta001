            Let's have a little background so that it can be understood beautifully. My parents, like many others,
            sought peace and spirituality in their lives. They were blessed with <b>OSHODHARA</b>, and naturally,
            I started going there at an early age.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
            As a child, I saw the enlightened gurus and thought they had some kind of mystical power—like reading minds
            or knowing everything. As I grew older and understood the world, I realized that it may or may not be true.

        <p class="post-content">
            Many of us believe enlightenment is an end product, a final treasure waiting at the end of the road. But
            that's a misconception. We've been conditioned to think that way—finish school, get a degree, get a job,
            and then you'll be 'free.'
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
            But true <b>enlightenment</b> is not something you acquire at the end of a journey. It is the journey itself.
            Through meditation, you dive deep within yourself. When you reach the end, you realize you already found it
            along the way. It’s that moment of <i>click</i>—a sudden understanding that this was it all along.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
            This is my perspective for now. Maybe in the future, my view will change. Time will tell.
